<center><i>At the 2017 World Championship</i></center>

In high school, I competed in [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com). In
VEX, teams build 18"x18"x18" robots to compete in a game each year. Teams
program these robots to drive both autonomously and with the control of a human
driver. Teams then attend regional, state, (sometimes) national, and
international tournaments where they play the game and attempt to advance.

In my senior year, I founded team 86868: The Resistance and won the 2017 VEX
Robotics High School World Championship in Louisville, Kentucky. Since then, I
have been giving advice as a mentor to the team.

## Awards

In the year I was on 86868 (2016-2017), we received 36 awards:

-   2017 VEX World Champion
-   2017 Engineering Division Champion
-   California State finalist (San Jose site)
-   13x regional tournament champion
-   1x regional tournament finalist
-   11x robot skills champion
-   5x Excellence award
-   2x Design award
-   1x Amaze Award

Our overall record for the season was 179 matches won, 23 lost, 1 tied.
