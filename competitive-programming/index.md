<center><i>At the 2018 ICPC SoCal Regional</i></center>

At its heart, competitive programming says: "Given these problems and a time
limit, solve as many as you can!" I participate in programming competitions
mainly as part of [ACM@UCI](https://clubs.uci.edu/acm). In addition, I maintain
accounts on several websites which I use for practice.

## Accounts

-   [UVa](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/945356) - over 200 problems solved and counting!
-   [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/btjanaka/)
-   [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/btjanaka)
-   [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/btjanaka)
