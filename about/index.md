Hi there! I am Bryon Tjanaka, an undergraduate computer science major at UCI.
I'm a researcher in the [Mobley Lab](https://www.mobleylab.org), where I work on
molecular dynamics [force
fields](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(chemistry)>), and a board
member of [ACM@UCI](https://clubs.uci.edu/acm), where I participate in
[competitive
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). Recently, I
worked at Google as an Engineering Practicum intern. Before coming to college, I
competed in [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com), where I won the 2017
High School VEX Robotics World Championship as founder and captain of 86868: The
Resistance.

On this website, you can find an assortment of materials I've put together about
myself. If you think anything is _too_ out of date or have questions about
something, feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Page%20not%20found">contact me</a>.
