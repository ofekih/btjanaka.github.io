Here are some projects I have worked on.

-   [Safeline](https://devpost.com/software/safeline-9eqyxs) - a project created
    at HackUCI 2019 with [Cody Enokida](https://github.com/codyenokida),
    [Brandon Khong](https://github.com/brandontkhong), and [Meta
    Novitia](https://github.com/metanovitia). It uses OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi
    to watch for people falling over, then it sends an email and iOS push
    notifications to users connected to it.
-   [Setup](https://github.com/btjanaka/Setup) - a collection of configuration
    files for my Linux machines. This is meant more for personal reference, but I
    decided to share it for fun.
-   [ccorgi](https://github.com/btjanaka/ccorgi) - a fun little program for making
    corgis run across your terminal screen!
