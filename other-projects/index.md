Here are some miscellaneous projects that I work on.

-   [Setup](https://github.com/btjanaka/Setup) - a collection of configuration
    files for my Linux machines. This is meant more for personal reference, but I
    decided to share it for fun.
-   [ccorgi](https://github.com/btjanaka/ccorgi) - a fun little program for making
    corgis run across your terminal screen!
